# NOTES

- writing a simple list rn, what i first thought of, it will be good practice. i know i can make it an array of pointers to elements and easily do it that way.
- how am i supposed to keep track of all the datatypes with all these `void *`'s ugh.

// brah totally forgot that list access in O(1) in python. maybe i can have the
// head of list_t as an array of pointers to each list_element_t
